# AraCore_AT_enhancement
Matlab source code that enhances AraCore with newly found AT activities and analyzes the effects

This software needs COBRA toolbox (for Matlab, tested with version 3.1) and Gurobi optimizer (tested with version 9.03) installed.
The correct local paths need to be edited in enhance_AraCore_minimal.m, then enhance_AraCore_minimal.m can be run
to recreated the findings from the paper.
